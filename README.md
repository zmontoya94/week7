Using the employees database you installed, write SQL queries that do the following (the SQL queries you write are what you will turn in for your homework):

1. Show all employees who were born before 1965-01-01
2. Show all employees who are female and were hired after 1990
3. Show the first and last name of the first 50 employees whose last name starts with F
4. Insert 3 new employees into the employees table. There emp_no should be 100, 101, and 102. You can choose the rest of the data.
5. Change the employee's first name to Bob for the employee with the emp_no of 10023.
6. Change all employees hire dates to 2002-01-01 whose first or last names start with P.

7. Delete all employees who have an emp_no less than 10000
